# SAMS — Sports Asset Management System

A Digital Asset Manager (DAM) built for professional soccer teams. SAMS centralises all club photography, video, and visual assets — organised by season, game, and event — with role-based access for staff, players, media partners, and sponsors.

## Features

### Asset Management
- Upload photos and videos directly to Wasabi S3-compatible object storage via presigned URLs (browser uploads bypass the server entirely)
- Bulk upload with drag-and-drop
- Rich metadata per asset: title, description, event name/date, location, category, and free-text tags
- EXIF data extraction and display for photography
- Asset detail view with inline metadata editing and combobox autocomplete for stadium and event/match fields

### Media Library
- Searchable, filterable grid of all club assets
- Filter by season, collection, category, and tag
- Fast asset loading via server-side presigned URL caching (Upstash Redis, 23 h TTL — avoids repeated round-trips to Wasabi)

### Collections
- Group assets into game-day or event collections
- Each collection tracks: name, type, date, opponent, venue, and associated season/stadium
- Cover image per collection

### Configure
- **Seasons** — define season periods; all assets, collections, and players are scoped to a season
- **Players** — roster management with headshots stored in Wasabi
- **Sponsors** — sponsor directory with logos and tier classification
- **Stadiums** — venue list used for autocomplete across the app

### Authentication & Access Control
- Powered by [Descope](https://descope.com) — passwordless, SSO, and social login out of the box
- Four roles: `ADMIN`, `PLAYER`, `MEDIA`, `SPONSOR`
- User profile management via embedded Descope profile widget (`/profile`)
